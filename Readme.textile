h1. KeepRunning

bq. You can run but you can't hide.

KeepRunning restarts a Ruby script whenever it stops, crashes or is killed.

There's two modes to use KeepRunning: Using the @keep_running@ bin with a config file (see example_runner_conf) or using a KeepRunning script (see example_runner_script). The only difference is a shebang line and a require line in the KeepRunning script. (Actually the script could as well being used as configuration file; This isn't true the other way round)

The invokation would look like this:

<pre><code>keep_running example_runner_conf one two three</code></pre>
<pre><code>./example_runner_script one two three</code></pre>

All further arguments will be passed to the process to be run. For the process running @$0@ will be it's own path. So basically if your Ruby script works on it's own, it's scriptname @$0@ and command line arguments @ARGV@ will be the same when launched by KeepRunning.


h2. Synopsis

A runner config would look like this:

<pre><code>KeepRunning.run do
  pidfile             '/tmp/keep_running_example'
  email               to: 'keep_running_test@trash-mail.com', from: 'keep_running_test@trash-mail.com', via: :sendmail
  restart_threshold   6
  restart_delay       60
  
  process 'example_script.rb'
end
</code></pre>

@restart_threshold@ defines how many seconds must be between restarts until a delay of @restart_delay@ seconds is kicking in.

h2. Caveats

This is a quick and dirty hack. Specs will follow soon.
