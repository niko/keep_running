h1. KeepRunning

bq. You can run but you can't hide.

KeepRunning takes a super simple configure file as argument: @keep_running example_runner@. All other arguments will be passed to the script to be run.

The runner config looks like this:

<pre><code>KeepRunning.run do
  pidfile             '/tmp/keep_running_example'
  email               to: 'keep_running_test@trash-mail.com', from: 'keep_running_test@trash-mail.com', via: :sendmail
  restart_threshold   6
  restart_delay       60
  
  process 'example_script.rb'
end
</code></pre>

@restart_threshold@ defines how many seconds must be between restarts until a delay of @restart_delay@ seconds is kicking in.

h2. Caveats

This is a quick and dirty hack. Specs will follow soon.
